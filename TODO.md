# What "To Do" For Our TodoMVU?

We left off with the "current value" of the textbox being stored in our Model

What's next?

- [x] 0. start with a refactor, "extract function" on handling of `UpdateTodo`
- [x] 1. we need a way to "add" the text from the textbox as an "entry" in the List Todo
- [x] 2. we need a way to render the existing List Todo
- [x] 3. we need a way to make the entries as "complete"

Bonus?

4. we need a way to filter by "completed" or not completed



# Beyond Part 2?

What could you do that might be interesting?

- Store the `List Todo` in `localStorage`
- Use Html.Keyed to implement handling of modifications to the DOM
- Make the items editable
